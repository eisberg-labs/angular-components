# Angular Components

Welcome to Eisberg Labs Angular Components, currently a placeholder repository linking to my angular project submodules.

I wrote about [why I switched to monorepo](https://www.amarjanica.com/switch-to-monorepo-with-lerna-and-rollup),
and now I'm telling you it's a bad idea - if the projects are unrelated.

What I should have focused on is :
- There are services that are free and [check for outdated dependencies](https://www.amarjanica.com/how-i-didnt-keep-my-open-source-libraries-up-to-date).
- There are Github actions that can automate everything.

Overall, lerna and monorepo can be a great idea, if the projects are related to each other like mui components.
